> Why not to pass the Order in constructor of OrderCommand

Decoupled Instantiation & Execution: The OrderCommand becomes reusable and testable without tightly coupling to a
specific Order instance at construction time.
Keeps OrderCommand stateless and idempotent.
Makes the command creation easier to manage using method references or lambdas.
Cleaner pipeline setup with simple suppliers like PlaceOrderCommand::new.
